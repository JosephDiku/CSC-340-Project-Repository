## About Me 
This is my third year at UNCG and for all three years I've been doing computer science. When I'm not doing school work and going to classes, I am often just chilling at my dorm or hanging out with my friends. I hope that this semester will go well.

## My CSC340 Goals
I hope that through this class we will learn to effectively start with nothing and be able to build ground up our own apps or ideas. This would give me the right skills needed to apply in my future.
